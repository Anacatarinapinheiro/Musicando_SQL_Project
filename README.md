# Music Streaming Database Project

## Introduction

This project was created as part of the **(UFCD)** on Data Management and Storage. The aim was to develop a database capable of supporting analytical and data management functionalities. **MySQL** was used for this project, employing **SQL** to create, model, and manage the database. **MySQL Workbench** served as the primary development and management tool.

## Project Description

The project involved developing a database similar to a music streaming platform. The primary goal was to create a system that stores detailed information about users and artists, providing a personalized and enriching experience. The database includes tables for user playback history, artist events, discographies, user-created playlists, and music genres.

To ensure efficient and comprehensive data organization, several essential elements were considered:

- **Artists**: Fields were included to record details such as discographies, upcoming events, and associations with specific music genres.
- **Songs**: Data such as titles, albums, and genres were included.

To enrich and diversify the stored data, various tools and languages were utilized:

- **Spotify for Developers API**: Explored to obtain detailed information about artists and their discographies.
- **Python**: Used to extract data such as song names, albums, track durations, and associated music genres.
- **Power BI**: Used to create tables from online sources, complementing information about live events by providing data on event dates and locations.
- **MySQL Workbench**: Utilized to create and structure the database tables, reflecting the organized data.
- **Excel**: Used to generate CSV files for direct data import into the database.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for running Python scripts to create visualizations.
