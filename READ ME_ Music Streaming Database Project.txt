Music Streaming Database Project

Introduction

This project was created as part of the Short Duration Training Unit (UFCD) on Data Management and Storage. The aim was to develop a database capable of supporting analytical and data management functionalities. MySQL was used for this project, employing SQL to create, model, and manage the database. MySQL Workbench served as the primary development and management tool.

Project Description

The project involved developing a database similar to a music streaming platform. The primary goal was to create a system that stores detailed information about users and artists, providing a personalized and enriching experience. The database includes tables for user playback history, artist events, discographies, user-created playlists, and music genres.

To ensure efficient and comprehensive data organization, several essential elements were considered. For artists, fields were included to record details such as discographies, upcoming events, and associations with specific music genres. For songs, data such as titles, albums, and genres were included.

To enrich and diversify the stored data, various tools and languages were utilized. Initially, the Spotify for Developers API was explored to obtain detailed information about artists and their discographies. Python was used to extract data such as song names, albums, track durations, and associated music genres.

Additionally, Power BI was used to create tables from online sources to complement information about live events, providing data on event dates and locations.

With a comprehensive and diverse data source, the next step was to organize this information in a structured manner and integrate it into the database. Tables were created in MySQL Workbench, reflecting the structure of the obtained data. Once the tables were defined, data was imported directly from a CSV file generated in Excel.
